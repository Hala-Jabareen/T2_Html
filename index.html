       <p>Jenin is a historic city in the northern West Bank, known for its deep cultural roots and significance in the Palestinian territories. With ancient origins, it has been a key agricultural and trade hub throughout history. Jenin is also home to a large refugee camp, established after the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, which has been a focal point of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, particularly during the Second Intifada.</p>
